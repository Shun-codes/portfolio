    "passionIntro": "Since my childhood, I have always been drawn to computers, video games, and the desire to always know \"How does this work?\"",
    "passionLycee": "At first, it was mainly mathematics that interested me, long before I discovered the Digital and Computer Science (NSI) specialization, which precisely combines math and computer science. In middle school, there wasn’t really an equivalent subject: the closest was visual arts, where I often stood out thanks to original projects. I loved experimenting and innovating, whether with 3D printing, laser engraving, or creating websites. This curiosity naturally led me to choose the NSI specialization in high school, which I immediately enjoyed. There, I discovered programming and wrote my first lines of code, notably in Python and HTML/CSS.",
